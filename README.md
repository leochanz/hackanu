Project Name (WIP): _DyslexiClear_

Executive Summary: Our application aims to revolutionise reading accessibility for people with dyslexia. 

Pitch: Although dyslexic-friendly fonts are sometimes availiable in hard copy materials, this isn't practical or viable for everyday use. Our web application leverages artificial intelligence and computer vision to convert any kind of text in the real world into an easily readable format in real time, allowing dyslexics to be able to read quickly and easily in any situation.

Key Features: 
- Real-time AI-powered text reading of images using Optical Character Recognition with Tesseract Engine
- Adaptive dyslexic-friendly font conversion to OpenDyslexic typeface, a font designed for dyslexics
- Cross-platform compatibility for use on multiple kinds of devices
